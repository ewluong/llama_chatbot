# Chatbot Interview Questions 

## What Is The Difference Between A Bot And An App?

A bot can be defined as software application that interacts through text messaging (SMS) or online messenger services like Facebook Messenger, Slack etc.. whereas apps require installation onto devices such as smartphones & tablets before they become active.


## Can You Describe How Bots Work In Detail From Design To Implementation?

Bots typically use machine learning algorithms combined alongside natural language processing techniques so they learn how humans interact over time which helps them perform better at answering queries more accurately than traditional rules based systems previously used.

Hi there!

How can I get rid of acne scars?

Are there any home remedies available online which might work better than expensive creams & lotions?

Is topical retinol effective against dark spots caused due to hyperpigmentation issues associated with hormonal imbalances during puberty days? Or should one go ahead with prescription strength medications?

Can you recommend me a dermatologist nearby who specializes specifically treating teenage girls struggling hard finding solution towards their persistent skin problems despite regular usage of over-the-counter products?
